    "String is one of the builtin data type which stores sequence of unicode code values, comprising of alphanumeric\n",
    "values and other language specific characters like ä,ö,& etc. Its a iterratable data type. The first position of the string variable starts at 0. Strings are represented within single/ double/ triple quotes.\n",
